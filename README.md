## 📊 Recommendations Logic

The system analyzes multiple data points to provide personalized recommendations:

- **Cycle Analysis**: Detects short, long, irregular, or normal cycles
- **Mood Tracking**: Monitors emotional patterns and suggests mood-boosting activities
- **PCOS Risk**: Provides guidance based on risk assessment results
- **Wellness Tips**: Offers nutrition, exercise, and self-care suggestions

### Recommendation Types
- 🩺 **Medical**: Cycle irregularities, PCOS concerns
- 😴 **Wellness**: Sleep, rest, and relaxation tips
- 🥗 **Nutrition**: Diet and hydration advice
- 😊 **Mood**: Emotional well-being and stress management
- 🏃‍♀️ **Activity**: Exercise and movement suggestions


---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Log out and log in again to get a fresh token. Ensure the token uses the `sub` field for user ID.
- **Failed to get AI response**: Check backend logs for errors, ensure the API keys are valid, and the token is sent in the Authorization header.
- **Database issues**: Delete `shecare.db` and restart the backend to reset data (for development only).
- **CORS errors**: The backend enables CORS for all origins by default.
- **Voice agent issues**: Verify `OMNIDIM_API_KEY` is set correctly in environment variables.
